This is particularly useful in underwater settings where color casts can be prevalent due to varying depths and water conditions.",

Additionally, color normalization adjusts each color channel to its 99th percentile, ensuring that the brightest colors are adjusted to pure white. This method effectively reduces the typical bluish or greenish cast seen in underwater images, leading to more natural and accurate color representation.",
