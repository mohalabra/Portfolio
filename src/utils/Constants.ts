          "The first approach involves initial enhancements to both contrast and white balance. For contrast, the image is converted to grayscale followed by histogram equalization. For white balance, corrections are made based on the gray world method, which assumes that the average of all colors in a scene naturally tends towards gray over the entire image. This is particularly useful in underwater settings where color casts can be prevalent due to varying depths and water conditions.",

          "The second approach focuses on adaptive contrast enhancement and color normalization. Unlike traditional methods, this technique utilizes Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), which prevents over-amplification of noise by limiting contrast enhancement in homogeneous areas of the image. Additionally, color normalization adjusts each color channel to its 99th percentile, ensuring that the brightest colors are adjusted to pure white. This method effectively reduces the typical bluish or greenish cast seen in underwater images, leading to more natural and accurate color representation.",
